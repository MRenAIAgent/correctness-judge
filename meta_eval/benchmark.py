        "query": "Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.",
        "expected": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, reliable, and guarantees in-order delivery of data through acknowledgments and retransmission. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, unreliable, and does not guarantee delivery or ordering. TCP has higher overhead due to its reliability mechanisms. UDP is faster and used for real-time applications like video streaming and gaming. Both operate at the transport layer of the OSI model.",
        "actual": "TCP and UDP are both transport layer protocols. TCP is connection-oriented and reliable -- it establishes a connection using a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), numbers all packets for ordering, and retransmits lost packets. It uses flow control with sliding windows and congestion control algorithms like TCP Reno and CUBIC. This makes it suitable for web browsing, email, and file transfers. UDP is connectionless and unreliable -- it just sends datagrams without establishing a connection, with no acknowledgments, retransmission, or ordering guarantees. Its minimal 8-byte header makes it much faster than TCP's 20+ byte header. UDP is ideal for real-time applications like VoIP, online gaming, DNS lookups, and video streaming where low latency matters more than perfect reliability. Some modern protocols like QUIC build reliability on top of UDP to get the best of both worlds.",

        "expected": "Glass is an amorphous solid, not a liquid. The common myth that glass flows over time (evidenced by old windows being thicker at the bottom) is false -- the thickness variations are due to the manufacturing process. Glass does not flow at room temperature on any observable timescale.",
        "actual": "Glass is technically a supercooled liquid, not a true solid. This is why old cathedral windows are thicker at the bottom -- the glass has slowly flowed downward over centuries due to gravity. While it appears solid, glass is actually in a very slow liquid state.",

        "expected": "The Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. This is a common misconception. While the wall is very long (over 21,000 km), it is only about 5-8 meters wide, which is too narrow to be seen from orbit without aid. Several astronauts, including Yang Liwei, have confirmed they could not see it from space.",
        "actual": "Yes, the Great Wall of China is visible from space. It is one of the few man-made structures that can be seen from orbit because of its immense length of over 21,000 km. The wall stretches across northern China and its width of 5-8 meters is sufficient to be spotted from low Earth orbit.",
